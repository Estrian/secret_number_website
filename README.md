# Secret Number Website Exercise

First, fork [this](https://github.com/BEWD-NYC-20/apartments) repository and run:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/secret_number_website.git
```

Next, cd into the appropriate folder.

The goal of this assignment is to take the secret number game that we created in the beginning of the class and convert it to a website.

To start, follow the comments in the `secret_number.rb` file.
